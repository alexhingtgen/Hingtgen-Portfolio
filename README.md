## General Information
My portfolio website was created to complete one of the required assignments for my Digital Product Management course at the University of Iowa. The assignment utilized knowledge learned throughout the class to create this digital landing page, which is intended to serve as a tool in future job application processes. The website highlights my technical abilities and proves my ability to work with HTML. I configured a domain that I purchased to my personal website and configured a Google Analytics account to track the web traffic of my portfolio page.

The completed portfolio website can be found at the following link: https://alexhingtgen.com/

## Technologies Used
- GitHub
- Microsoft Azure
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML coding language
- CSS coding language

## Features
The ready features for my online portfolio include:
- General information regarding work experience and organization memberships
- Professional images and photos relating to my interests
- Section for accomplishments and hobbies
- Links to external resources like my LinkedIn account
- Attractive design largely based on a template version

## Setup
All of the necessary files and coding needed to replicate this project can be found in the project folders and requirements.txt file. For users looking to take this project and make it their own, the following steps would apply:
1. Clone this repository to local computer using the project link
2. Rename the directory to reflect the new project name
3. Delete .git folder
4. Continue working with the project and making desired edits
5. Make commits for the project and track changes

## Usage
One goes about using my portfolio website by browsing the various pages on the website to learn more information about my life, achievements, goals, and hobbies. Additionally, users could clone this GitHub project and make edits to the template to discuss their own personal information.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_. The portfolio page was finalized in May of 2022 and the website information pertains to events up to this point. Because of the nature of the portfolio and potential to add future achievements, the portfolio website will likely have changes to provide updates in my life. One simple way to update the website would be by uploading a current resume with changes made.

## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Website design could flow more smoothly and offer a more simplified path through the pages
- Professional image of myself on the Home page could be larger and higher quality
- Links showing information about the organization memberships I have could be provided

To do:
- Update the portfolio website as new events and successes occur in my life
- Upload new photos and a current resume after some time passes
- It could be wortwhile to add more pages to the website to further display who I am

## Acknowledgements
The portfolio website project was assigned by the University of Iowa Associate Professor of Practice named Michael Colbert and guidance was provided by the teacher throughout the project. Furthermore, the portfolio design came from a free, multipurpose html5 template on Initio.
