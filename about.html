				<p class="lead text-center text-muted">The improvement of the foundations of our communities helped me choose business as my field of study. I set high standards for myself in school, evidenced by my six placements on the University of Iowa President’s List, and I work tirelessly to reach my goals. Outside of the classroom, through joining different campus organizations I have met individuals that share a mutual passion for networking and exceeding expectations. Last summer, I served as an Assurance Intern at EY where I was able to prove my skills in professional skepticism and attention to detail when dealing with complex accounting issues.</p>

				<h3>Scholarship</h3>
				<p>Performing well in the classroom has always been a top priority of mine as I firmly believe that my education will provide
					me with the tools to accomplish my ambitions. While majoring in both Accounting and Business Analytics, I have been
					on the University President’s List each semester since I was a freshman. I have earned a cumulative GPA of 4.14 and can
					confidently say the long hours have been worthwhile. My success in the classroom guided me to tutor student athletes in
					gaining a deeper understanding in their studies. Additionally, I have joined the Tippie Business Honor Society and Beta
					Gama Sigma to collaborate with fellow scholars.</p>
				<h3>Leadership</h3>
				<p>My ability to set an example and inspire others has been pushed as I have grown as a leader within the community.
					I am the current President of the Tippie Technology and Innovation Association and have found excitement in working
					towards goals larger than myself. Under my leadership, Tippie Tech has doubled student membership participation and IT
					company speakers from last year. I have spearheaded organizing various types of events including two job fairs and the
					CyHawk case competition. Moreover, while serving two terms as the Director of Brotherhood for Alpha Kappa Psi
					business fraternity, I took initiative to promote camaraderie within Tippie by planning social events with other
					organizations. Building upon my leadership abilities has shown me the importance of being an effective communicator. I
					have focused on expanding my interpersonal skills and am proud to have won the Junior Year Writing Award in the
					accounting program.</p>
				<h3>Experiential Learning</h3>
				<p>By seeking experiential learning opportunities throughout college, I have learned more about my business interests and
					developed relationships that will bolster my career advancement. I have completed an internship each summer while in
					college and have learned about the accounting industry in different sized companies. The three companies that I interned
					with all offered me an opportunity to continue working after my internship, exhibiting my ability to work well with my
					teams. This past summer I served as an Assurance Intern with EY in Minneapolis and was elated to receive a full-time
					offer from the company. Being involved in the audit of a Fortune 50 company with EY enabled me to enhance my
					analytical skills and critical thinking in a hands-on environment. I was encouraged to use my analytics background to
					improve process efficiencies and trust my judgment in evaluating financial documents. Currently, I am also in the BAIS
					capstone course and have been working with a start-up winery business in developing a risk analysis projection to support
					their expansion into a new county.</p>
